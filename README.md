# Python Chatroom
A basic chatroom built in Python.
## Features
- Real-time messages to and from clients
- Join and leave messages
- List of online members
- Unique colors for each client (new)
- Suspicious looking code
## How to use
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/). Versions 3.9.6 or higher should work as this is what the app was programmed in, however, previous versions of Python 3 may also work.
2. Run or edit the server file to change the port that it will be hosted on (default is 42069 haha funny number). Portforwarding will be required if clients are on a different network.
3. Launch the client.
   - **If you are connecting locally:** The IP address will be the IPv4 address of the server, which can be found in cmd using `ipconfig`
   - **If you are connecting remotely:** The IP address will be the public IP address of the server, which can be found from a Google search, or [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)
   
   The port will be the one defined by the server, and you can choose a nickname.
4. Press ok, and you're set! :D
